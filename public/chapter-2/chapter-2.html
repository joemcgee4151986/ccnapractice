      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="d" id="q2d">d. None of the other answers is correct.<br>

      <h3>3. Which of the following is true about Ethernet crossover cables for Fast Ethernet?  </h3>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a" id="q3a">a. Pins 1 and 2 are reversed on the other end of the cable.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b" id="q3b">b. Pins 1 and 2 on one end of the cable connect to pins 3 and 6 on the other end of the cable.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="c" id="q3c">c. Pins 1 and 2 on one end of the cable connect to pins 3 and 4 on the other end of
      the cable.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="d" id="q3d">d. The cable can be up to 1000 meters long to cross over between buildings.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="d" id="q3e">e. None of the other answers is correct.<br>

      <h3>4. Each answer lists two types of devices used in a 100BASE-T network. If these devices
        were connected with UTP Ethernet cables, which pairs of devices would require a
        straight-through cable? (Router and hub and Wireless access point (ethernet port) and switch or two answers. Find the third) </h3>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a" id="q4a">a. PC and router<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b" id="q4b">b. PC and switch<br>

      <h3>5. Which of the following are advantages of using multimode fiber for an Ethernet link
        instead of UTP or single-mode fiber?</h3>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a" id="q5a">a. To achieve the longest distance possible for that single link.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b" id="q5b">b. To extend the link beyond 100 meters while keeping initial costs as low as possible.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="c" id="q5c">c. To make use of an existing stock of laser-based SFP/SFP+ modules.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="d" id="q5d">d. To make use of an existing stock of LED-based SFP/SFP+ modules.<br>

      <h3>6. Which of the following is true about the CSMA/CD algorithm? </h3>

      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="b" id="q6b">b. Collisions can happen, but the algorithm defines how the computers should notice
      a collision and how to recover.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="c" id="q6c">c. The algorithm works with only two devices on the same Ethernet.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="d" id="q6d">d. None of the other answers is correct.<br>
    
      <h3>7. Which of the following is true about the Ethernet FCS field?</h3>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="a" id="q7a">a. Ethernet uses FCS for error recovery.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="b" id="q7b">b. It is 2 bytes long.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="c" id="q7c">c. It resides in the Ethernet trailer, not the Ethernet header.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="d" id="q7d">d. It is used for encryption.<br>
